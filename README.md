# ML

In this repo, I try and implement my learning outcomes in Machine Learning on public datasets by using python and famous libraries. In some cases, I used plain python to have better understanding of the models.

As I learn more techniques, this repo will also grow in varity of methods used.

### So far:

  1- Data Visualization is done by matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn with:
  
    - Boxplots, histograms, heatmaps, barplots, violinplots and line graphs.
    
   Yet to learn: Pie charts and high-dimensional visualization.

  2- Data Handling is done by numpy, sklearn and built-in pandas methods. Used techniques are:
   
    - Creating dummy variables for categorical variables
    - Data scaling
    - Data transformations for numeric variables (e.g. log transformation)
    - Missing data handling (e.g. by frequency, mean, median)
    - Dimensionality reduction by PCA
    
   Yet to learn: Different transformations according to model and different dimensionality reduction techniques.
   
  3- Feature Selection is done by sklearn:
    
    - Forward and backward selection
    - Regularization methods
    
   Yet to learn: Statistical Tests and other sub-set search methods.
   
   4- Models:
   
    a- Regression:
      - Linear Regression
      - Polynomial Regression
      - Ridge Regression
    
    b- Classification:
      - Linear Discriminant Analysis
      - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
      - Logistic Regression
      
   Yet to learn: Decision trees, Support Vector Machines, Ensemble methods
